    What Zend Server Does:
    - Helps developers write better code and solve issues long before their code reaches production (‘Left Shifting’).
    - Automates all steps in the release of PHP applications, from code to production, including provisioning, versioning and rollback.
    - Optimizes performance through dynamic scaling, code acceleration, code and data caching, job queuing and more.
    - Helps to detect and fix production issues in applications, faster and with less disruption.
    - See README for how to deploy. Use the regular Apache htdocs for basic PHP usage. Log into the Zend Server gui at http://<Server_IP>:10081/ZendServer for advanced usage.
